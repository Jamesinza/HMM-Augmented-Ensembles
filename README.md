# Meta-Learner-Ensemble
The basic idea behind this experiments is to use multi layered meta learners with base models instead of simple ensembling techniques like manually weighting or aggregating base outputs to produce better results. Using meta learners can sometimes offer better results since the network adjusts its parameters based on the sample seen at the time.
